# My Solutions to Exercises

## Section 3.1
1. Confirmed. It does.
2. Verified. It works.

## Section 3.2.1
1. Successfully generated Foo controller with `rails generate controller Foo bar baz`
2. Successfully destroyed Foo controller with `rails destroy controller Foo bar baz`

## Section 3.4.2
1. Tests run successfully. Replaced "Ruby on Rails Tutorial Sample App" in `test/controllers/static_pages_controller_test.rb` with an instance variable `@base_title` and used string interpolation to inject `@base_title` into the title of each page.

## Section 3.4.3
1. Contact Page added. Added `get "static_pages/contact"` route. Added `contact` action in StaticPages controller. Created new Contact Page view (/views/static_pages/contact.html.erb). Added content to Contact Page. All tests pass.

## Section 3.4.4
1. Test passes. Test looks similar to other tests written so far: 
```
test "should get root" do
  get root_url
  assert_response :success
end
```
2. Commenting out `root 'static_pages#home'` does cause tests to fail, and tests pass when uncommented.

## Section 4.2.2
1. `city = "Chicago"`, `state = "Illinois"`
2. `puts "#{city}, #{state}"` #=> `Chicago, Illinois`
3. `puts "#{city},\t#{state}"` #=> `Chicago,        Illinois`
4. `puts '#{city},\t#{state}'` #=> `Chicago,\tIllinois`

## Section 4.2.3
1. `"racecar".length` # => 7
2. `"racecar".reverse` # => "racecar"
3. `s == s.reverse` # => true
4. `prints "Its a palindrome!"`; returns nil and prints nothing

## Section 4.2.4
1. `s == s.reverse`
2. Confirmed.
3. Confirmed.

## Section 4.3.1
1. `a = ["A man", "a plan", "a canal", "Panama"]`
2. `s = "A mana plana canalPanama"`
3. 
```
s = s.split.join  #=> "AmanaplanacanalPanama"
s = s.downcase    #=> "amanaplanacanalpanama"
s == s.reverse    #=> true
```
4. `alpha[7]`           #=> 'h'   
   `alpha.reverse[7]`   #=> 's'

## Section 4.3.2
1. `(0..16).map { |e| puts 2**e }`
2.
```
def yeller(array = [])
  array = array.map { |elem| elem.upcase }
  return array.join
end
```
3. 
```
def random_subdomain
  return ('a'..'z').to_a.shuffle[0..7].join
end
```
4.
```
def string_shuffle(s)
  s.split('').shuffle.join
end
```

## Section 4.3.3
1.
```
spanish = { one: "uno", two: "dos", three: "tres" }
spanish.each do |key, value|
  puts "'#{key}' in Spanish is '#{value}'"
end
```
2. 
```
person1 = { first: "Matt", last: "Layton"}
person2 = { first: "Lucas", "last: "Van Duyne" }
person3 = { first: "Sir Frostington", last: "Kittypuss" }
params = { father: person1, mother: person2, child: person3 }
#=> {:father=>{:first=>"Lucas", :last=>"Van Duyne"}, :mother=>{:first=>"Matt", :last=>"Layton"}, :child=>{:first=>"Sir Frostington", :last=>"Kittypuss"}}
```
3.
```
# random password generator
def random_pw
  return ('a'..'z').to_a.shuffle[0..15].join
end

# user hash
user = { :name => "Matt Layton", :email => "layton.matt1986@gmail.com", :password_digest => random_pw }
#=> {:name=>"Matt Layton", :email=>"layton.matt1986@gmail.com", :password_digest=>"jxadqirmbklzwogt"}

```
3. It does work

## Section 4.4.4
1. & 2. (Removed toy_app files from c9)

## Section 4.4.5
1. Revised `example_user.rb` file:
```
class User
  attr_accessor :first_name, :last_name, :email
  
  def initialize(attributes = {})
    @first_name = attributes[:first_name]
    @last_name = attributes[:last_name]
    @email = attributes[:email]
  end
  
  def full_name()
    "#{@first_name} #{@last_name}"
  end
  
  def formatted_email
    "#{full_name} <#{@email}>"
  end
end
```
2. 
```
def alphabetical_name
  "#{@last_name}, #{@first_name}"
end
```
3. `user.full_name.split == user.alphabetical_name.split(', ').reverse` #=> true

## Section 5.1.1
1. `curl -OL cdn.learnenough.com/kitten.jpg`
2. `mv kitten.jpg app/assets/images/`
3. `<%= image_tag("kitten.jpg", alt: "Cute Kitten" %>`

## Section 5.1.2
1. `<%#= image_tag("kitten.jpg", alt: "Cute Kitten") %>`; kitten image does not show up at all in source code
2. Added

2. The change in #1 does cause one test to fail.

## Section 5.4.2
1. Added `signup_path` in previous section.
2. Test does run red when commented out, green when not commented out.
3. Added test to navigate to sign up page and verify title is correct:
```
get signup_path
assert_select "title", full_title("Sign Up")
```

## Section 6.1.1
1. `schema.rb` does not contain `id` field, since its automatically generated by the db.
2. `schema.rb` contains no table data once rollback is performed.
3. Re-running migration adds the data back to `schema.db`

1. Confirmed: all valid addresses match, all invalid addresses do not
2. Added updated regex: tests pass now
3. Confirmed: all valid addresses (still) match, all invalid addresses (still) do not

## Section 6.2.5

=> nil
```
`puts user.attributes.to_yaml` yields identical console output results as `y user.attributes`

## Section 7.1.2
1. Added with `<%= @user.created_at %>, <%= @user.updated_at %>`
2. Added with `<%= Time.now %>`; time updates each time browser is refreshed.

## Section 7.1.3
1. `puts params.to_yaml` #=>
```
--- !ruby/object:ActionController::Parameters
parameters: !ruby/hash:ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess
  controller: users
  action: show
  id: '1'
permitted: false
nil
```
2. @user = nil

## Section 7.1.4
1. eaced42f18e456a5e142146facc83c99
2. This code does work as expected.
3. This does work. The `options` hash parameter allows for the possibility of passing multiple options into the helper; the keyword arguments form gives the helper _only_ the `size` option.

## Section 7.2.1
1. "Undefined method 'nome' for User..."
2. Replacing all occurrences of `f` with `foobar` does still work. It would still be a bad idea, though, because variable names should have some indication of what their function/reference is.
3. 
## Section 7.2.2
1. Forms are more complicated than typical HTML features and require more understanding of back-end processes for form submission, validation, and database storage than other markup features, so its MORE than enough to be dangerous with.

## Section 7.3.2
1. Admin parameter does show up in debug dump:
```
--- !ruby/object:ActionController::Parameters
parameters: !ruby/hash:ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess
  admin: '1'
  controller: users
  action: new
permitted: false
```

## Section 7.3.3
1. Changing minimum length of password to 5 does update error message: "Password is too short (minimum is 5 characters)"
2. Both are routes for the `GET users#new` action. When clicking the Signup button on the home page, the `signup_path` is called, which is defined in the routes as `get '/signup', to: 'users#new'`. When submitting the Signup form, however, an invalid form submission reloads the /users url via the call to `render 'new'`, which route is defined in `resources :users`, thus allowing for two different paths to display the same page.

## Section 7.3.4
1. Implemented error message tests as follows:
```
assert_select 'div#error_explanation'
assert_select 'div.field_with_errors'
```
2. Making these changes does ensure the URL /signup shows for both unsubmitted and submitted-with-errors signup pages. All tests still pass, because the form does not POST/#create successfully, so `users#new` is rendered each time, which is what our test currently expects.
3. Tests are still green after `changing users_path` to `signup_path`.
4. Made appropriate changes to tests and all tests pass. New test added is: `assert_select 'form[action="/signup"]'`

## Section 7.4.1
1. User is created successfully: `User.count` is 2, and `User.find(2)` returns the newly-created user.
2. Both forms of the redirect work successfully and correctly.

## Section 7.4.2
1. `"#{:success}"` => Returns the raw string "success"
2. The flash iteration exercise uses symbol interpolation to convert the key and value of each message into a string before `puts`ing them to the console.

## Section 7.4.3
1. `User.find_by(email: "example@railstutorial.org")`
2. Done, and Gravatar correctly appears.

## Section 7.4.4
1. Per the hint given in the exercise: `assert_not flash.empty?` Added an additional test to make sure the correct key shows up for the flash: ` assert_select 'div[class$="success"]'`
2. Using `content_tag` to clean up the flash HTML still passes all tests.
3. Tests do fail with a "RuntimeError: not a redirect! 204 No Content" when the redirect command is commented out.
4. If `@user.save` is false, nothing will be written to the database, so the `User.count` will not be increased by one.

## Section 7.5.3
1. SSL lock and `https://` both appear in browser bar of Heroku app.
2. Profile successfully created and Gravatar appears correctly.

## Section 8.1.1
1. `GET login_path` retrieves the page that displays the login form. `POST login_path` transmits the login form data to the server for validation.
2. 
```
rails routes | grep users#
 ``signup GET    /signup(.:format)         users#new
          POST   /signup(.:format)         users#create

          PUT    /users/:id(.:format)      users#update
          DELETE /users/:id(.:format)      users#destroy
```
```
rails routes | grep sessions#
    login GET    /login(.:format)          sessions#new
          POST   /login(.:format)          sessions#create
   logout DELETE /logout(.:format)         sessions#destroy
```

## Section 8.1.2
1. Rails knows to submit the form to the Sessions controller's `create` action because we've defined the `form_for` url as `login_path` and the data will be `post`ed; `post login_path` is defined in our routes as using the `sessions#create` action of the controller.

## Section 8.1.3
1. Using Rails console, each of the values in Table 8.2 were confirmed to be correct.

## Section 8.1.5
1. Followed sequence in browser and flash properly disappears when a subsequent request is made.

## Section 8.2.1
1. bFFmZ2ExSjM4ZC9KT2piajdIVHN4NTVjTUxQbmhSU2xkNmh2TkZlbFMyeWY2OFRwV2I1M3RjVld4enA2S0p1R2s1bXc5MTlYUWpveUtGMlMweEZ1NHlsekNsRzdMMjRGeVpGLzZoclhSNGdLY3VJc2NrdEV1Z1Q5c0c5NE1KWE5JVUtQOXdKemlvNU50S3VVYTZiL3RRPT0tLTdTK2lqWUZ4RDE4ZHQ1YTdMcnp3VWc9PQ%3D%3D--e1285218a90b714974e8a1a3f8495f9583fe3265
2. At end of session

## Section 8.2.2
1. `User.find_by(id: 4)` returns nil (database currently only has 3 users in it.)
2. 
```
>> session = {}
>> session[:user_id] = nil
>> @current_user ||= User.find_by(id: session[:user_id])   #=> nil
>> session[:user_id] = User.first.id                       #=> 1
>> @current_user ||= User.find_by(id: session[:user_id])
#=> #<User id: 1, name: "Rails Tutorial", email: "example@railstutorial.org", created_at: "2017-08-19 20:57:18", updated_at: "2017-08-19 20:57:18", password_digest: "$2a$10$cYWVJ7BP7bm9u5OZJMEhIuShPStlMeFcsWASvtt4LHu...">
>> @current_user ||= User.find_by(id: session[:user_id])
#=> #<User id: 1, name: "Rails Tutorial", email: "example@railstutorial.org", created_at: "2017-08-19 20:57:18", updated_at: "2017-08-19 20:57:18", password_digest: "$2a$10$cYWVJ7BP7bm9u5OZJMEhIuShPStlMeFcsWASvtt4LHu...">
```

## Section 8.2.3
1. Removed session from browser cookies and layout _does_ revert to non-logged-in state.
2. Closing browser completely and opening application again does correctly switch between logged-in and logged-out states.

## Section 8.2.4
1. Removing the bang from the Sessions helper `logged_in?` method does cause the "login with valid information" test to fail. Reinserting the bang causes all tests to pass again.

## Section 8.2.5
1. The "valid signup information" test fails.
2. Confirmed. Commenting out triggers toggle action.

## Section 8.3
1. The "Log out" link does cause the correct changes to final site layout. It redirects to home page (root_path), and "Log in" link replaces the User's profile toggle menu.
2. Cookie for session data seems to persist after logging out, but disappears from cookie list when closing and re-opening browser. Site functionality seems to work properly, even if session data is persisting.

## Section 9.1.1
1. 
```
>> user.remember_token
=> "fMup-1SRebhfb7dWWXTFxg"
>> user.remember_digest
=> "$2a$10$v3pTVlP1gpUl4uwtJn4bSOCYnNCyqIFeFThulP6xN8rhNEIhbSTxK"
```
2. Both implementations in Listings 9.4 and 9.5 are correct (although, yes, very confusing).

## Section 9.1.2
1. Browser's cookies show a cookie for both the `user_id` and `remember_token`.
2. Duly verified.

## Section 9.1.3
1. After successfully logging out, cookies are properly deleted from browser storage.

## Section 9.1.4
1. An error does occur if one browser tab is logged out of and user attempts to then log out of the second tab.
2. Likewise, an error does occur if two different browsers are logged in, one is logged out of, and the second is closed and reopened without logging out.
3. When test suite is run, all tests pass.

## Section 9.2
1. The checkbox does have its intended effect -- placing remember cookies in the browser when checked, and removing them on browser close when unchecked.
2. [Played around with ternary operator in console.]

## Section 9.3.1
1. Modified `sessions_controller` to make `user` variable an instance variable, and added the following test to the `users_login_test`: `assert_equal cookies['remember_token'], assigns[:user].remember_token`. All tests pass.

## Section 9.3.2
1. Tests fail when the `authenticated?` expression is removed.
